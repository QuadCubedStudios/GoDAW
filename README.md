What is GoDAW
-------------
GoDAW is a free and open source [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation) made in [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
Which allows you to create music. 
> Note: GoDAW is still in it's early alpha stage.

Why GoDAW ?
---------
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is a amazing open source game engine. Godot is not only used for making games. Many have used godot for making applications. It has come to a point that one can make an entire game using only godot and godot-made projects like [pixelorama](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama), [Material Maker](https://github.com/RodZill4/material-maker) ect. We have covered art. But music, which can change the mood of the game, which enriches your experience with joy was an unknown territory. So GoDAW.

Features
--------
* Piano roll (Only the piano works)
* Song Editor (Can't edit song)
* DIY instruments (Make your own instruments!! with gdscript)

Cloning Instructions
--------------------
GoDaw is developed in godot 3. You need any version of godot 3 (3.1, 3.2, 3.3). As of now GoDAW is entirely made in GDScript so the Mono version of godot is not needed. You can run GoDAW in the Mono version too
