What is GoDAW
--
GoDAW is a free and open source [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation) made using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) Game Engine.

> Note: GoDAW is still in it's early alpha stage.

Why?
--
While Godot was intended to be used as a game engine, it has a very flexible API that allows for non-game applications, especially since the Godot Editor is itself built with Godot. Some examples include [Pixelorama](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama) and [Material Maker](https://github.com/RodZill4/material-maker), which deal with images and texturing respectively. Godot also provides a decent audio API, and there was a distinct lack of Godot projects that use it for more than just playing sounds. Hence, GoDAW was born.

In all honesty though, the GoDAW pun was too good to pass up, thanks to [@luiq54](https://github.com/luiq54) from the Pixelorama Discord server for the name!

As of commit [27e4e20](https://github.com/QuadCubedStudios/GoDAW/commit/27e4e20d0f59e207047c0da10054ef34ad062f6e)

Running
--
GoDAW is developed using Godot 3.x (3.1, 3.2, preferably 3.3). As of now GoDAW is entirely made in GDScript so the Mono version is not needed, but should work.
